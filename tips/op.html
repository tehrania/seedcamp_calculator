<h1>Option Pool</h1>
<p>First things first; This is the size of the Option Pool as a percentage of the <b>POST-MONEY</b> Valuation and where <strong>ALL of it comes from the founder's equity.
    This is the least founder-friendly way to present this</strong>, but it is also the point at which most early stage investors will start the negotiations. Read the 'More Info' section for more commentary on this.<br>
<br>
So what is the Option Pool?  Simply explained, the Option Pool is the percentage of your company that you are
setting aside for future employees, advisors, consultants, and the like.  
<br><br>
The expectation from traditional venture firms is that this will equal 15%-25% of the company <b>after</b> they 
make their investment.  The Option Pool is 
one of the most complex and, from the entrepreneur's perspective, confusing terms in an equity financing scenario.
