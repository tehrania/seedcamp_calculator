<h1>Post-money Valuation</h1>
<p>The Post-money valuation is the sum of the pre-money valuation and the money raised in a given round.  
At the close of a round of financing, this is what your company is worth (well, at least on paper).  
</p>
<p>The only reason it's worth spending time on this term at all is that it "sets the bar" for 
your future activities.  If your post-money after your first round of financing is $4 million,
you know that to achieve success, in the eyes of your investors, any future valuations will have 
to be well-in-excess of that amount.
