<h1>Investment / Money Raised</h1>
<p>The investment, or money, raised is quite straight forward from a definition perspective -- Simply, how much
money is raised in a given round of financing.  <i>However</i>, the decisions (and their implications) surrounding
this number are among the most important that a founding team makes.</p>    
<p>
In brief, it is not just about how much money is raised -- it is about the terms that the money is raised 
on and, maybe most importantly, whose money it is and what they bring to the table in addition to money.
